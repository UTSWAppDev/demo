            : git merge origin/main<br><br>
            // Resolve conflicts, if there are any. Once the merge is complete, your local file will now reflect both your<br>
            // changes as well as your teammates earlier changes. Now you are able to push your local branch to the remote.<br><br>
            : git push origin main<br><br>
            // Repeat these steps of modifying content, commiting, and pushing for the remaining two team members until<br>
            // everyone has modified the file.<br><br>
            // Now feel free to explore! Have team members add files, change files, and share your commits together on<br>
            // the main repository.
